# Universal Emoji

## Why?

default windows emoji picker is so slow and takes forever to load  
so I decided to create this userscript to quickly insert emojis in any textare/input field.
it also has support for kaomojis.

## How to use

first install the usercript from [greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/452192-universal-emoji-kaomoji)

quickly insert emojis by wrapping them in colons for ex: `:rooser:` will turn into `üêì`

and to insert kaomojis just type the name after a `/` ex: `/need_a_hug` will turn into `„Å§ ‚óï_‚óï‡ºΩ„Å§`

you can find the name of all the supported kaomojis here: https://universal-emoji.vercel.app/  
to use them with the usescript replace the spaces with underscore for example: flipping tables to /flipping_tables

## Know issues

the script doesn't work on the new reddit design or discord or any website that implement their own text fields.
